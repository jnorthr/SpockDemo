Here is a brief gradle build sample including some Java and groovy classes, then all tested with Spock test tool

You only need a working java JVM on your system, version 1.5+ and you do not need to install gradle or groovy or java JDK

From command terminal, do these commands :

[source,bash]
----
mkdir xxx
cd xxx
git clone git@github.com:jnorthr/SpockDemo.git
cd SpockDemo

gradlew tasks            // to see what tasks are available in gradle

gradlew run              // run the gradle wrapper which reads the build.gradle file
:compileJava
:compileGroovy
:processResources UP-TO-DATE
:classes
:run
JavaSample               // since mainClassName = "JavaSample" that's what is run giving Hello World
Hello World

gradlew clean build     // recompiles everything and runs tests declared in JavaSampleTests.groovy++
:clean
:compileJava
:compileGroovy
:processResources UP-TO-DATE
:classes
:jar
:assemble
:compileTestJava UP-TO-DATE
:compileTestGroovy
:processTestResources UP-TO-DATE
:testClasses
:test

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

.What went wrong:
[source,bash]
----
Execution failed for task ':test'.
> There were failing tests. See the report at: file:///Volumes/PENDRIVE/gradledemo/SpockDemo/build/reports/tests/index.html
----

Follow directions above to try for yourself. I left a few bugs in the test just for demo purposes. 

When Spock tests fail, Spock creates a set of html pages to describe the failures. Copy the "file:///Vol..." name into a browser address bar, press enter key to see what Spock found --- 

Enjoy !
