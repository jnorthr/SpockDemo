SpockDemo
=========

A brief gradle build sample including some Java and groovy classes, then all tested with Spock test tool

You only need a working java JVM on your system, version 1.5+ and you do not need to install gradle or groovy or java JDK. All necessary source is here on github. Your system will need a 'git' tool to clone/download this full demo suite. See: http://git-scm.com/downloads  to get a client tool if you need one.

Follow directions in technotes.txt file to try gradle and spock for yourself. I left a few bugs in the test just for demo purposes. 

Enjoy !
